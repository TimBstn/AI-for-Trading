# AI-for-Trading

A collection of projects based on the Udacity nano degree program [AI for Trading](https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-for-trading--nd880?irclickid=30Yx9hzggxyNRFW0Vm26Pw3CUkDWtp1zXVcm2M0&irgwc=1&utm_source=affiliate&utm_medium=&aff=2201027&utm_term=&utm_campaign=__&utm_content=&adid=786224).

1. [Momentum Trading](https://github.com/TimBstn/AI-for-Trading/blob/main/momentum.ipynb) <br>
The newest hype in the finance world is algorithmic trading. Everybody wants to implement automated trading strategies that outperform the market. Imagine just feeding data into your machine and it does the rest for you. Hedge funds like Renaissance Technologies made billions with their algorithmic trading strategies. In this notebook, we are implementing one of the basic strategies: Momentum. Momentum strategies follow the idea that outperforming stocks keep outperforming and underperforming stocks keep underperforming. <br>

2. [Breakout Trading](https://github.com/TimBstn/AI-for-Trading/blob/main/breakout_strategy.ipynb) <br>
We will code and evaluate a breakout-strategy in python. In this strategy an investor looks for levels that a security has not been able to move beyond and waits for these levels to break, i.e. the security to move beyond those levels. <br>

3. [Smart-Beta Portfolio](https://github.com/TimBstn/AI-for-Trading/blob/main/smart_beta.ipynb) <br>
Imaging having an investment universe of stocks, e.g. all the companies in the S&P 500. To create a portfolio, you have to ask yourself the question on how to weight them. An easy option would be to follow the index weighting and take a market cap approach. On the other hand, you could come up with your own weighting matrix, and this is where smart beta comes into play. A smart beta portfolio gives the investor exposure to one or more types of market characteristics that are believed to predict market prices. Normally, smart beta portfolios follow relatively simple rules that are passively managed and in this post we will implement a dividend yield based approach. So, smart beta investors normally follow an index while also considering alternative factors in choosing the stocks from the index. <br>
